"""Behaviour contracts for the Omarchy VM realm kind.

Native-VM lifecycle needs KVM and a base image and is proven by the E2E rig,

conversation routes to, what a routed execution context declares about the far
side's filesystem, and that the host-escape guard blocks the escape it was
written for without blocking ordinary work.
