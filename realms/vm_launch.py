"""Run one argv inside this conversation's Omarchy VM realm.

Usage: python -m realms.vm_launch HERMES_HOME VM_ID -- PROGRAM [ARG ...]

This is the ``command_prefix`` half of the VM realm, the counterpart to
``realms.launch`` for labwc realms. The terminal tool hands us a fully built
``bash -c <script>`` argv; we hand it to sshd in the guest and relay the
process's streams and exit status back. stdin/stdout/stderr are inherited by
ssh, so byte-for-byte piping, heredocs and the terminal tool's CWD markers work
unchanged.

The guest's HOME is not the host's. A host path in the command therefore simply
does not exist in there, which is the boundary doing its job — use
``realm(action=push)`` to copy work in.
