"""Durable VM data receipts, independent of ephemeral compute ownership.

These detect accidental replacement, not a hostile same-UID administrator.
Mutable overlay/firmware are inode-bound; immutable spec/base metadata and the
SSH pin are sealed. Incomplete legacy work is retained, never auto-recreated.

Receipts never record ``st_dev``: the kernel numbers btrfs subvolumes, device
mapper and NVMe devices at mount/probe time, so it changes across reboots for
the same file. Each object is instead required to live on the same filesystem
as its directory (no mount point standing in for it), and is bound by inode.
Older receipts that recorded a device number are compared without it.
