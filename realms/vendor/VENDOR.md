# Vendored `omarchy vm`

`omarchy-vm` in this directory is [omacom/omarchy PR #10977](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/pull/10977)'s
`bin/omarchy-vm`, which adds a disposable Omarchy guest in QEMU/KVM to Omarchy
itself. It is vendored rather than depended on so Realms works before that PR
merges and on machines whose Omarchy predates it; a system `omarchy vm` can be
preferred instead via `plugins.realms.vm.omarchy_vm_path`.

The guest it builds is installed by Omarchy's own GPG-verified release ISO. We
do not build, host or modify an image.

`vm_manager` re-checks the vendored digest before every invocation, so a
tampered or silently upgraded copy is never executed. The pin lives in Python,
not in a checksum file beside the script: a checksum an attacker can rewrite
pins nothing. After editing the script, update `VENDORED_SHA256`.

## Local patches

These adapt upstream's single-user assumptions for one guest per conversation
and keep its unattended preset compatible with the selected stock installer.
Nothing else is changed.

**1. Per-session unit, sockets and ISO directory.** Upstream hardcodes the unit
name `omarchy-vm`, one QMP socket path and an ISO directory inside the VM's own
home. Realms runs one guest per conversation, so all three become environment
overrides (`OMARCHY_VM_UNIT`, `OMARCHY_VM_QMP_SOCKET`, `OMARCHY_VM_VNC_SOCKET`,
`OMARCHY_VM_ISO_DIR`) that default to upstream's values. The ISO directory moves
out of the per-session home so one 5 GB download is shared by every clone rather
than re-fetched per chat.

**2. Headless.** `graphics_args()` upstream opens an SDL window, which would
appear on the user's own desktop — precisely what a realm exists to avoid. The
vendored copy always renders to a software framebuffer with `-display none` and
serves RFB on a mode-0600 unix socket, which is both what the existing noVNC
viewer already speaks and what lets QMP `screendump` work at all.

**3. No implicit package installation.** `cmd_install` upstream calls `omarchy-pkg-add`
to install `qemu-full edk2-ovmf mtools`. The vendored copy only *checks*
for them with `pacman -Q`; the Desktop setup review separately requests
administrator consent for missing allowlisted packages, and
`hermes realms vm doctor` reports what is missing for the user to install.

**4. An optional netdev suffix.** `OMARCHY_VM_NETDEV_EXTRA` is appended to
QEMU's `-netdev` so `plugins.realms.vm.network: false` can pass `restrict=on`,
which refuses the guest's outbound routes while keeping the SSH forward that
reaches it.

**Explicit SSH identity.** Installer connections use the exact key whose public
half is provisioned into the guest, with ambient SSH configuration and agent/X11
forwarding disabled. OpenSSH otherwise resolves default identities from the OS
account's home, not the installer environment's `HOME`.

**Exact release selection.** The optional `install --version X.Y.Z` selects a
literal stable ISO version (decimal components, no `v` prefix or leading zeros).
It never resolves latest, and uses the existing download and pinned-signer
verification for both fresh and cached ISOs. Invalid versions, duplicate
selections and combining `--version` with `--iso` fail before installer effects.
The manager forwards its optional `release` input only to the pinned vendored
installer and records that selected filename, not the last sorted cache entry.
Custom installers retain their legacy unpinned path; explicit release selection
refuses them. This input seam does not implement Update/Later consent or UI.

**Stock installer kernel defaults.** CIDATA omits both `kernels` and
`omarchy_install.storage.kernel`. The selected stock installer owns that choice:
generic 4.0.3 defaults to `linux`, while 4.0.4 defaults to `linux-omarchy`.
Retaining either old override defeats 4.0.4's default; forcing `linux-omarchy`
would instead break 4.0.3's offline package selection. Disk layout, encryption,
SSH provisioning and unattended behavior are unchanged. This does not select
or fall back to a different release, add packages, or modify the ISO.

## Updating

1. Fetch the new upstream `bin/omarchy-vm` and record its SHA-256 here.
2. Re-apply the local patches above.
3. Set `VENDORED_SHA256` in `realms/vm_manager.py` to the new digest.
4. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_realms_vm.py tests/test_realms_vm_kernel_preset.py` (see [running the tests](../../docs/testing.md))
   — the headless, parameterisation and CIDATA-default patches are covered by
   behaviour tests that execute the script's own functions, so a dropped patch
   fails there.
5. Rebuild a base image and start one realm: the install path is not covered by
   the unit tests.
